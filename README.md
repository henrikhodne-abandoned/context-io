## Description

ContextIO is a Ruby wrapper for the [Context.IO][contextio] web service.

Context.IO is the missing email API that makes it easy and fast
to integrate your user's email data in your application.

ContextIO follows the rules of [Semantic Versioning][semver] and uses
[TomDoc][tomdoc] for inline documentation.

[semver]: http://semver.org

## Installation

The best way to install ContextIO is through Rubygems:

```
$ [sudo] gem install context-io
```

If you're installing from source, you can use [Bundler][bundler] to pick up all
the gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

[bundler]: http://gembundler.org

## Usage

The ContextIO classes map pretty much one-to-one to the Context.IO API
resources, which you can find [on their documentation site][contextiodocs].

[contextiodocs]: http://context.io/docs/2.0

### Authenticate

ContextIO uses two-legged [OAuth][oauth] for authentication, which means you
need to get an API key from [Context.IO][contextio]. The API key consists of a
consumer key and a consumer secret, and once you have them you can set up
ContextIO like this:

```ruby
ContextIO.configure do |config|
  config.consumer_key = 'consumer key'
  config.consumer_secret = 'consumer secret'
end
```

[oauth]: http://oauth.net/

### Get an Account object

Once you're authenticated, you can get an `Account` object, which is what you
will be dealing with most of the time.

```ruby
account = ContextIO::Account.all.first
```

You can also find accounts matching a given email address.

```ruby
account = ContextIO::Account.all(:email => 'me@example.org').first
```
